The 1,400-acre Musser Scout Reservation, located in Northwest Montgomery County, is home to three sub-camps, each with their own charm and personality. Below you will find links to each of the camp maps to help you navigate while you are within a certain camp.

In addition to the sub-camp maps, Musser Scout Reservation has more than 10 miles of hiking trails for Scouts of all levels to enjoy. Our Reservation Trail Map outlines the trails and shows how the sub-camps are connected as part of the largest forest in Southeast Pennsylvania.
