The Musser camping experience is not just a summer thing. Throughout the autumn, we host Fall Fest - a half day program that keeps the adventure of Cub Scouting and Cub Camp happening for the whole family!  The program is offered in a newly redesigned open program format. Sign up for a morning (9-11) or afternoon (1-4) block to experience our Fall program offerings with your family. Activities are designed for Cubs of all levels and abilities, and may include: Archery shooting, BB gun shooting, Crafts and Pumpkin Carving, Fishing, Ozobots, carnival games, Nature, and more family fun!

All Youth will receive a Fall Fest patch. You donâ€™t want to miss out on the magic Musser has to offer all year long.
