Spend a day at Musser Scout Reservation during Fall Fest! Fall Fest is a day-long program designed to introduce you and your Cub Scout Family to what Cub Scouting has to offer.  Your Cub Scout will get to try many different activities to get them excited about Cub Scouting and Summer Camp.  All of the day’s activities are designed for Cub Scouts of all ages/ranks. Fall Fest will give you a glimpse of what Summer Camp is like.  Lunch is included with your registration, and all Scouts will get a Fall Fest Patch!
 
***New in 2019*** – Open program format.  In 2019 we introduced an open program format and it was met with overall great reviews! All program areas were open from 9am-3pm and your family or Pack decided what to do, when to do it, and how long to do it for.  It is a stress free relaxed day for the whole family!!!  Lunch was also an open format where you could go to the Dining Hall anytime from 11am-1pm for lunch served cafeteria style.  Again, you decide when to go, where to sit, and how much time to spend.
Activities include:
Archery, BB gun shooting, Slingshots, Apple Chucking, BMX Bikes, Bouldering Wall, Crafts, Scout Skills, Science, Drone flying, and MORE family fun activities!!!!

Save the Date for 2020 Fall Fest October 10, 11, 17, 18, 24, 25, 31, and Nov. 1 - Registration will go live in August!
