Musser Scout Reservation is available for non-Scouting groups to rent. The variety of facilities available are ideal for private parties, weddings, corporate events, and other outside events - even LARPing groups. Many venues serve as perfect outdoor and rustic settings. Our facilities available include the Dining Hall, a kitchen, open-air pavilions, and campsites, as well as themed structures including a Wild West Fort, a Medieval Castle, and a Pirate Ship. Event planners, prepare to let your imaginations run wild as you consider Musser Scout Reservation for the locale of your next event.
