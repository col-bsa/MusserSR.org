We are excited to reintroduce Cub Family Weekends at Musser – June 5-7 and June 12-14. These weekends in June have the goal of making the outdoor experience fun for all families while being simple for a family to attend. You bring your family and a positive attitude, and we’ll supply the tent, food, and FUN!! Sleep in a summer camp tent, eat in the dining hall, and eat a S’more around the campfire – all of the favorite parts of camp made easy by the camp staff!

Registration will go live in January, so stay tuned for more details and we’ll see you in June!
