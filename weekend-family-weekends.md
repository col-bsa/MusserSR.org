Back and better than ever, our Cub Family Weekends are a way for the whole family to enjoy the Musser camping experience. Different than our summer camp program opportunities, this weekend is designed with your family in mind. You bring your family and a positive attitude, and we’ll provide the food, tent, and program to round-out a simple and fun time in camp. Meals will be served in the Dining Hall and you’ll sleep in a canvas wall tent on a platform - just like summer camp - while the rest of the weekend is made easy by our camp staff, including some S’mores around the campfire.

Check back in January for more details about registration and program as they become available!
