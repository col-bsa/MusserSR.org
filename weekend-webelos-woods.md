Are your Webelos ready to Crossover into Scouts BSA? Are there a few more skills that they need to learn or practice to feel confident when they join a Troop in the Spring? We want to help every Webelos feel confident when they cross the bridge, and Webelos Woods is our way of helping fill the gap!

Webelos will join us for a weekend of camping September 25-27 where they will pitch their tent, practice Scout skills, and meet new friends while learning what Scouts BSA is all about. We know the crossover can be scary, but those who attend Webelos Woods will be more prepared and more confident when they join a Troop and start the next level of their Scouting adventure!

Registration will go live in the Spring, but be sure to save the date so your Webelos can join us!
