Have you felt cooped-up all winter when all your kids want to do is get outside and play? Beat the winter blues by joining us for Cub Scout Spring Fling on Saturday, May 16 where your kids can have a great day at camp participating in exciting programs including Nature, STEM, Archery, BB’s, Handicraft, Scoutcraft, BMX, and MUCH more!

Registration will go live in January, so stay tuned for more details and we’ll see you in May!
