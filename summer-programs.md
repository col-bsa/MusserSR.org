We offer 3 unique programs throughout the summer at Musser Scout Reservation.  Whether you're looking for an overnight adventure or just some day time activities, our highly trained staff will be excited to see you in camp!

<h2>Day Camp</h2>
A week long, Monday through Friday program that is great for those younger Scouts -- Tiger through Bear (1st – 3rd graders)  not ready for Overnight Camp yet and those that want more Scout programs without the overnight component.  Program begins at 9am daily Monday-Friday and ends at 4pm daily.  Lunch is provided for all day campers each day.

[Bussing is available for Day Campers](/summer/bus)

<h2>Weekend Overnight Camp</h2>
Starts Thursday evening and runs through Sunday afternoon giving you 3 nights and 3 days to enjoy program at Musser.  A great option for younger Cub Scouts – Tiger through Bear (1st – 3rd graders) and families that can not take a full week off work but can take 1-2 days off.

<h2>Week Long Overnight Camp</h2>

Starts Sunday afternoon and runs through dinner Friday, giving you 5 nights and 5 days of program at Musser.  This option is ideal for older Cub Scouts – Webelos and AOL Scouts (4th and 5th graders), but can be an option for any age Cub Scout and family.

Both Overnight options start each day with a Polar Bear Swim being offered at 7am.  Program continues throughout the day, scouts and leaders will get 3 meals a day during their length of stay (breakfast, lunch and dinner).  After the day program rotation, the fun continues with certain areas being open with special activities for your Cub Scouts to enjoy.  Campers get the chance to experience evening program after dinner with themed activities and some extra pool time during twilight swims.  During the week the camp offers camp wide campfire programs that scouts can partake in with staff.
