<h2>Campmasters <div class="h5">The Key to Outstanding Customer Service</div></h2>
The Campmasters are a group of registered Scouters who help ensure our units have a positive experience during their stay at camp. From the time that a unit checks-in, through when they check-out, the Campmasters are there to help with any problems that may arise, open the Trading, Post, as well as offer program for the Scouts in camp.

Campmasters select the weekends they are able to help, and many enjoy it as a fun way to enjoy camp. If you are interested in helping make the camp experience great for our units in camp, [contact Campmaster Chairman Jerry Rafter](/contact?subject="Campmaster") to schedule a weekend or three!
