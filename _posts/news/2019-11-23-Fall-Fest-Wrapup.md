What an exciting Fall at camp! We are thankful for the Cub Scouts and their families who joined us for a Fall adventure. Scouts enjoyed pumpkin carving, shooting sports, STEM, drones, apple chucking, and much more!

Thank you to everyone who joined us for Fall Fest, and we hope you'll join us for Spring Fling and Summmer Camp!
