excerpt: Bring your friends and family for a day of service at Musser Scout Reservation.

We have lots of projects, both large and small that we need assistance with.  We are asking units, leaders, Scouts and their families to help provide “A Day of Service” to Musser Scout Reservation.  Spend the day with us and help get Camp Garrison, Camp Delmont and Camp Hart ready for another Fall camping season. 

- Projects will range from picking up limbs, stacking wood, general campsite cleanup, and organizing things just to name a few.
- We have some tools at camp, but if you can bring your own as well as work gloves – that would help tremendously. Tools that could help would include shovels, rakes, strong backs and a helpful spirit to help complete the many projects as needed!
- *Are you a trade expert or have experience in a trade (carpenter, plumber, electrician, mechanic, etc.) – please let us know!
Please let us know if you can help and how many people you will be bringing so we have enough projects!*

Please register online so we know to expect you. Once you register, we will contact you or the unit and arrange projects ahead of time, which allows you or your unit to know what to plan for. 

If you have any specific questions on projects – contact Ranger Lynn at Brian.Lynn2@scouting.org or (215)804.9596.
