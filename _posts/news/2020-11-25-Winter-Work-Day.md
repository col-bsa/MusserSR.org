Spend a day outside at Musser Scout Reservation! Join the Musser Scout Reservation Property Committee and Ranger Lynn on Saturday, December 19th for a winter work day. We need your help to develop a list of projects and determine the areas that we need to improve on the reservation. This event is for scouters, families, and friends of scouting. We're looking for volunteers with a variety of skills and backgrounds to help put together this list. You can attend for an hour or for the full day. All Council COVID Policies will be followed and volunteers are asked to bring their own food/water.  Please feel free to bring friends or families and share this event with anyone that you feel could help.

For more information, or to let us know that you would like to attend, please contact Ranger Lynn at Brian.Lynn@scouting.org.
