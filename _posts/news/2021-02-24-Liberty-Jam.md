excerpt: Help us celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the Cradle of Liberty Council
---

2021 marks the 25th Anniversary of the Cradle of Liberty Council, and we are marking the occasion by hosting several events for Scouts, leaders, and their families to participate in! On Saturday, March 13 we’ll have the Battle of the Bands, a family-focused competition event. On May 21-23 we’ll have The Main Event – three simultaneous events, one at each sub-camp, so we can be physically-distanced but have a great time! Check-out [colbsa.org/25](http://colbsa.org/25) for all of the details and to register for these exciting events!
