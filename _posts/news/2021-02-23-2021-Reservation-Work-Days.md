We are looking for adults with technical skills or a helpful spirit to help at Musser on the second Saturday of each month (aside from December, which is the third Saturday) for our Reservation Workdays. These days are focused around smaller groups with skills that help us make camp a fun and safe place for our Scouts through maintenance and improvement projects. If you can join us for a specific day, contact Ranger Lynn at Brian.Lynn@scouting.org or (215) 804-9596 to express your interest and coordinate the project youâ€™ll work on.
