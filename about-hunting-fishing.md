<h2>Hunting</h2>
We offer Hunting to a small group of hunters during the two-week Antler season
following Thanksgiving. If you are interested in Hunting at Musser Scout Reservation,
please complete this contact formÂ and we&#39;ll get back to you shortly.

<h2>Fishing</h2>
The Unami Creek, which runs through Camp Hart and Camp Delmont, offers fishing opportunities for Scouts and adults. A PA State fishing license is required, and all state and local regulations must be followed. For non-Scouts fishing on the property, we suggest a donation of $30 for your fishing experience to help improve camp.
